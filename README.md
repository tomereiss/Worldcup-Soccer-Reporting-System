The project provides a service for updates on soccer game competitions to a community of subscribers (clients). Subscribers can register for specific games, receive updates, and report to other subscribers. Each client can subscribe to one or more topics and can send messages to any of the topics they are subscribed to. Any message sent to a topic is relayed by the server to all clients subscribed to that topic. Communication between the client and server is done using a custom protocol, with messages sent as frames with a defined structure.
